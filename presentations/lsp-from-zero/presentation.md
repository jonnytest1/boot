# Build Video

Pitch:
- Build a language server from scratch
  - no dependencies
  - minimal stdlib usage
  - NOTE: It won't actually do anything useful.
    The point of the video is to show you HOW a Language Server
    communicates with a client.

- By the end of the video:
  - Connect to an editor
  - Handle:
    - Document Synchronization
    - Hover
    - Code Actions
    - Autocomple Suggestions

    TODO: Should I implement a "goto definition" function?
    - It's a bit weird to not show that...

- Goal of the video:
  - Understand LSP by building
    - NOT: Build a compiler.
    - We won't actually provide real completions, definitions, etc.
  - NOT: Have an LSP for a language

# Goals
