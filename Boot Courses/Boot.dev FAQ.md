Yes, I did really and truly quit my job. That's not a troll.

What is boot.dev?
- LEARN BACKEND DEVELOPMENT THE SMART WAY
- Welcome to the most captivating, finger-flying, addictive way to learn to code
	- One of the coolest things about the site is all of the content is available to READ for free. Any associated videos are also available for free (pretty sure, gotta check).
	- Interactive exercises, AI chat assistant, Discord, etc is paid only (https://www.boot.dev/pricing)

What isn't boot.dev?
- It's not a catalog, it's a syllabus
- Not open for new courses except through Lane
- Not a tutorial site
	- Tutorial: A step by step guide to accomplish a task I think that our guided projects are close to a tutorial, but they honestly are more like an assignment in college

What am I doing at boot.dev?
- I'm not the creator, I'm just making courses for Lane (who is awesome).
	- Courses will include:
		- Text
		- Video
		- Exercises

How did I find out about boot.dev?
- Found Lane on the Twitters and thought he was really funny
- He invited me to be the first guest on Backend Banter, liked him a lot and thought what he was trying to do on boot.dev was really cool  (I like when people have fun and want others to have fun)
- When I was thinking about going full-time streaming/content, I reached out to Lane to talk to him about some stuff and we decided it would be really fun to partner and make some sweet courses together!

What course are you planning on doing?
- First Course: Basics of Memory Management
	- Garbage Collection
	- Manual Memory management in C
	- Garbage Collection Continued
	- (brief intro) Borrow Checking / Lifetime analysis
- Second Course (series of courses): Learning Rust
	- Will include project based learning (of course, it's boot.dev that's the point)
- Third Set: Functional Programming w/ OCaml (if we don't get booted first)

What's the timeline for the courses?
- No idea, I'm not sure how long it's going to take me to make these :)

Where is boot.dev?
- On the internet

What are the pre-requisites of boot.dev?
- None! The first course assumes you know nothing (like trash_dev)

What's unique about boot.dev?
- I like the tone of boot.dev, that it tries to make things fun and enjoyable.
- I think programming is fun, so it's nice to see a site that wants to be fun.

Do you have to pay to use boot.dev?
- Mentioned this earlier, but all the content is free to read/watch. It's just the interactive parts of the site that are not free.
