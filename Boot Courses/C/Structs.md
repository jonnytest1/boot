- Basic Syntax
	- [[examples/structs_basic_syntax.c|structs_basic_syntax]]
	- However, kind of annoying to always have to say "struct coordinate" instead of how we have been able to say "int" or "float" normally.

- `typedef`
	- [[examples/structs_typedef_example.c|structs_typedef_example]]
	- Now we can use `coordinate_t` instead of always typing `struct coordinate`

- Initializers
	- Positional
	- Designated
	- `{0}` <- zero initialized
	
- `typedef` as well
- `sizeof(T)`
- Padding / alignment
